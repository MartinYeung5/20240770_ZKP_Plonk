# A guide to Zero Knowledge Proofs

Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic techniques that allow a prover to convince a verifier that a given statement is true without revealing any additional information.

ZKP represent a significant advancement in the field of cryptography and privacy-preserving computation, and some folks compare ZKPs to the creation of a new form of computing in the sense that they introduce novel ways of representing, manipulating, and reasoning about information. ZKPs expand the range of problems that can be solved and the methods by which they can be approached, introducing new mathematical abstractions and tools to reason about information and its manipulation.

Zero Knowledge Proofs allow for more expressive and powerful privacy-preserving protocols, as the primary focus is on the relationships and transformations between different pieces of information, rather than the specific values themselves. This means that ZKPs offer a unique computing paradigm that focuses on privacy-preserving computation. This allows for the verification of computations without revealing the underlying data or the specifics of the computation itself.

Zero-knowledge proofs can also be viewed as a form of knowledge-compression technology, as they allow the prover to convince the verifier of a statement’s truth without transmitting the entire witness. This results in a smaller proof size and reduced communication overhead, making zero-knowledge proofs suitable for applications with bandwidth limitations or where privacy is paramount.

Additionally, ZKPs can be used as a means of verifiable computation, as they enable the prover to prove the correctness of the computation without revealing any information about the computation’s input, output, or internal detail.

Zero-knowledge proofs achieve verifiable computation through the following process:
